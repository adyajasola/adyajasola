### 🧠 About Me
I’m a Computer Science student at UIC who enjoys building **data-driven, analytical, and scalable applications**.  
I love connecting the dots between **AI, visualization, and real-world decision systems** — whether that’s predicting demand, optimizing prices, or making sense of complex datasets.
